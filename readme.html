Melanopsin Ganglion Cells Are Physiologically Tuned to the Central Circadian Clock. Front. Neurosci. 15:652996. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.652996">10.3389/fnins.2021.652996</a></p>

<p>To run, enter <code>ipRGCephys</code> at the MATLAB command prompt. Simulated current-clamp voltage traces for M1 and M4 ipRCGs will be plotted as in Figure 1D. The value of Iapp is specified at the top of the file. This code was developed in MATLAB R2020b.</p>
